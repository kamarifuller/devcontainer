# Source Code Version Control Tools

This repository contains the configuration files for the development environment, the code for our project, as well as our CI/CD pipeline itself. It contains everything needed for development besides our software tools like Docker Desktop and Visual Studio Code. Our benefits come by way of:

- Easy collaboration
- Secure and reliable storage
- History of changes
- Efficient software integration
- Automatian
- Increased feedback

## Version Control

Github was my choice of VCS. It is widely used, has plenty of resources available, and had the tools needed readily available over a few other options.

## Repository Setup

This repository is our one stop shop for development. It contains the container configuration files, our applications code, and the workflows through github. At the root of our repository we have our most important directories 

> Devcontainer configuration files: [.devcontianer](../.devcontainer)

> Dependency and Github Workflow files: [.github](../.github)

> Software application files: [app](../app)

> Documentation on the various tools and code in our repository: [docs](../docs)

> Flutter test application: [test_drive](../test_drive)

> Document with basic repository overview and index: [README.md](../README.md)
